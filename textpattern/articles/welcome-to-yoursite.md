When you write an article you assign it to a section of your site.

Sections use a page template and a style to define how site content appears in a browser.

Page templates typically use HTML and Textpattern tags (like this: <txp:article />) to build the output code.

Some Textpattern tags use forms, reusable building blocks that provide extensive control and customization over your site construction.

Pages, styles and forms can be packaged into themes and assigned to one or more sections.

Textpattern tags, their attributes and values are explained within the Textpattern User Documentation, where you will also find valuable examples, advice and tutorials.

There’s also a group of friendly, helpful Textpattern users and administrators at the Textpattern support forum.

Additional language translations and corrections are welcomed. Please visit Textpattern language translations for further details.
